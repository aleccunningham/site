## Illinois Sports Business Association

Architected, designed and developed the web platform for ISBA. They were looking for a new static site, but also wanted to keep track of members. The outcome is located on [http://illinoisba.org/](http://illinoisba.org/), with the code hosted on the [`ispa-project`](https://github.com/marjoram/ispa). It's built using the Django python web framework; we kept the home page static, but `ispa-project` has an authentication system, calendar, RSVP system, payment service, and blog. It's hosted via [Google Cloud Platform](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleccunningham/) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images paired with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). You can find the configuration for ISBA [here](https://github.com/marjoram/gcp-ispa).
